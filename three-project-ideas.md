Bandmember
----------------------



### Overview

Want to really feel like your heard? Now its becoming easier with the new Bandmember app.

We give you the chance to have your music flow to the right people and places for it to be heard and enjoyed.
We provide a platform to not only upload but to listen and review new up and coming artists.

Just enjoy listening to fresh new music?
We have the place for you too.
Keep up to date following your newest favourite bands and artists.

What can me provide?

Well, we can connect you with other like minded musical individuals that are also looking to collaborate. Finding the perfect producer is a breese with a customer based rating service so we can tailor the sound to you. 

This will be app based using location serivces to help keep things local.



### Pros

+ Helps young up and coming talent.

+ Gives me a chance to learn new app building skills past invision.

+ I also have an interest in following new artists music.



### Cons

+ Will be a big step up from invision to creating a fully fuctioning app.

+ Has a lot of large key parts such as location services, music sharing, reviews.

+ Might be too much to take on and maybe I should focus on one key part.



### How might it be built?

For this project I'm going to focus on Android for starters.
It could equally be built on Invision but it like to try and learn a new skill such as using Android Studio.



### Who’s it for?

The target market would obviously be musicians but as for age it would be closely grouped around the 18-25 years of age. Keeping this in mind as i would be designing this with young up and coming music talent in mind.



### What’s the business model?

For this service I would imagine there would be base monthly premium with addidtion costs for extra features such as the producer finder. We can justify this in my opinion as you will save money going direct to the right producer plus it will keep the price more competitive.

Would take user research and testing to really consolidate the pricing options.

Boredom
----------------------



### Overview

Ever find yourself sitting in with nothing to do?

Want to learn some new skills, save money and meet new people?

This app helps you find activies in your local area that you and or others can enjoy.
It will make suggestions based off of your interests on things to do around you, providing you with weekly offers to help you maybe learn a new talent and save money while your doing it! 

We work with local businesses to help provide you with these deals but also to ensure you get what your paying for!



### Pros

+ Gets people out socialising whilst benifiting local businesses.

+ Find people with similar intrests as you.

+ Free app based off of advertising if possible.



### Cons

+ It Would take a lot of reaching out to local businesses to keep the app up to date and relevant for the user.

+ I will need to learn more on web-based marketing and how I can use that to my advantage.



### How might it be built?

This project woud be best suited built as an app.
I am new to app building so I will need to research and learn new software such as Android Studio, I am choosing it based off of my own device. 



### Who’s it for?

The target market for this project would be 18+ with a main focus on students. The app though will be relevant to all as it will provide you information based off of your interests and places you have visited previously.



### What’s the business model?

This project will strive to be a free app with a business model based off the advertising from local businesses. Also digital gifting could be a means of revenue.

InHouse Viewing
----------------------



### Overview

Making Real Estate easier.

We aim to provide a fully immersive experience when viewing your next dream house no matter if you're in your own home or your local Real Estate Agency.

Using Virtual Reality you can explore many different house viewings at your own leisure without leaving the seat.

This helps you save your time and money trying to find the right home for your future. 



### Pros

+ Saving money and time.

+ I am intrigued by VR and would like to learn more about it.

+ Real Estate is a very large market.

+ Perfect for people who find it a challenge travelling or if the property is a long distance away.



### Cons

+ I have no experience with building for VR.

+ Every house on the system would need to be photographed and scanned into the application.

+ It would rely mainly on the real estate agency providing the VR headset in office as headsets are not widely popular as of yet in homes.



### How might it be built?

I would imagine this project as a web site built usng web standards  for clients to log on and view their selected potential new homes.
Each home would need photographed in a similar method I would imagine to Google Map's Street View, allowing the client to move in the virtual environment.


### Who’s it for?

This project would be perfect for first time buyers, renters, familys, investors. Information needs to be displayed clear and concise. Also this project will be designed towards the real estate agents themselves as they will be providing their clients the necessary information to make use of the VR capabilities


### What’s the business model?

For this project I would say it would be a feature paid for by the real estate agency and factored into the commission charge as mainly it will be the agency benefiting from this project, allowing for a faster turn over time.
